# YIN Algorithm Comparison: Real-time iOS vs Offline pYIN

**Date**: 2026-02-28
**Song**: "Feeling Good" (cmlkprw8y0007mh01gcwzvozs) — vocal stem, 238s

**Context**: This comparison was performed to evaluate whether the on-device YIN algorithm produces reference pitch data comparable to pYIN (librosa). The results confirmed that on-device YIN is accurate enough for both real-time detection and batch reference pitch extraction, enabling the fully on-device architecture (no Python worker needed).

## Algorithms Compared

| Parameter            | iOS YIN (real-time)        | Offline pYIN (librosa)            |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Algorithm            | Pure YIN (Accelerate vDSP) | Probabilistic YIN (HMM smoothing) |
| Sample rate          | 44,100 Hz                  | 44,100 Hz                         |
| Analysis window      | 2,048 samples (46.4 ms)    | N/A (internal)                    |
| Hop size             | 256 samples (5.8 ms)       | 512 samples (11.6 ms)             |
| YIN threshold        | 0.10                       | N/A (HMM-based)                   |
| Confidence threshold | 0.85                       | N/A (HMM-based)                   |
| Frequency range      | 80-1,100 Hz                | 65-2,093 Hz                       |
| RMS noise floor      | 0.01 (was) / 0.005 (now)   | None                              |

## Results (before tuning, RMS = 0.01)

### Sanity Check: Local pYIN vs Stored Reference

- **100% match, 0.0 semitone difference** — offline pYIN is deterministic

### iOS YIN vs Stored Reference

| Metric                                   | Value                   |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Voiced frame match rate                  | 76.4% (9,832 / 12,863)  |
| Pitch accuracy (within +/-1 semitone)    | 92.2% of matched        |
| Median pitch difference                  | 0.17 semitones          |
| Mean pitch difference                    | 0.63 semitones (7.7 Hz) |
| 95th percentile difference               | 1.39 semitones          |
| Missed (ref voiced, iOS silent)          | 3,031 (23.6%)           |
| False positives (iOS voiced, ref silent) | 277                     |

## Root Cause: Why iOS YIN Misses Frames

| Rejection reason        | Frames lost | % of ref voiced |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| RMS noise gate (< 0.01) | 2,569       | 20.0%           |
| Low confidence (< 0.85) | 804         | 6.3%            |
| No YIN detection (tau)  | 128         | 1.0%            |

The RMS noise floor was the dominant source of missed frames — quiet vocal moments that pYIN captures but the noise gate silenced.

### Confidence Distribution (of frames where YIN found a pitch)

| Threshold | % of detections above |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| >= 0.50   | 100.0%                |
| >= 0.70   | 97.5%                 |
| >= 0.75   | 96.5%                 |
| >= 0.80   | 94.7%                 |
| >= 0.85   | 92.1%                 |
| >= 0.90   | 87.2%                 |

## Decision: Lower RMS Noise Floor to 0.005

Changed `PitchConstants.rmsNoiseFloor` from `0.01` (~-40 dB) to `0.005` (~-46 dB).

**Impact**:

- Match rate: 76.4% -> 78.7% (+2.3%)
- Accuracy: 92.2% -> 91.7% (negligible loss)
- False positives: 277 -> 300 (+23, minimal)
- Picks up quiet vocal passages previously gated as silence

## Key Takeaways

1. **pYIN and YIN produce similar pitch values when both detect voice** — median difference is only 0.17 semitones.
2. **The algorithms differ mainly in voiced/unvoiced classification** — pYIN's HMM smoothing catches borderline frames that plain YIN + threshold gates reject.
3. **iOS YIN is intentionally conservative** — for real-time singing, false positives (phantom notes) are worse than missed frames.
4. **RMS noise floor is the biggest tuning lever** — it alone accounts for 20% of missed frames.
5. **The confidence threshold at 0.85 sits at a natural break point** — the confidence distribution shows a gradual falloff, so lowering it yields diminishing returns with more noise.
6. **On-device YIN is viable for batch reference extraction** — the accuracy difference vs pYIN is small enough that a Python worker is not needed. This enabled the fully on-device IntonavioLocal architecture.

Where both detect voice, Hz values typically agree within 1-3 Hz.
