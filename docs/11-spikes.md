# IntonavioLocal — Validation Spikes

## Overview

Before committing to the full implementation, three spikes validated the riskiest technical assumptions. Each spike was a time-boxed prototype focused on answering a specific question.

## Spike A: iOS Real-Time Pitch Detection

### Question

Can we detect a singer's pitch in real time on iOS using AVAudioEngine + YIN with latency under 30ms and accuracy within +/-10 cents for sustained notes?

### Approach

1. Create a minimal SwiftUI app with microphone access
2. Set up AVAudioEngine with `installTap` on the input node (buffer size: 1024, 44.1kHz mono)
3. Implement the YIN algorithm in Swift
4. Display detected frequency + note name in real time
5. Measure round-trip latency (audio buffer arrival -> UI update)
6. Test with a tuning app or known-pitch audio source for accuracy

### Success Criteria

| Metric                | Target                       | How to Measure                                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Latency (buffer -> UI)| < 30ms                       | Timestamp in tap callback vs UI update        |
| Pitch accuracy        | +/-10 cents on sustained notes | Compare against hardware tuner on same signal |
| CPU usage             | < 15% on iPhone 12+          | Xcode Instruments profiling                   |
| Confidence threshold  | > 0.8 filters noise reliably | Test in quiet and noisy environments          |
| Min detectable pitch  | <= 100 Hz (G2)               | Test with low male vocal samples              |

### Risks

- **Noise sensitivity**: YIN may produce false positives in noisy environments -> mitigate with confidence threshold and optional noise gate
- **Low pitch accuracy**: 1024-sample buffer may struggle below ~80 Hz -> fall back to 2048 buffer for bass voices
- **Thread safety**: Tap callback runs on audio thread — dispatch to main must not cause jank

### Deliverables

- Working prototype app with real-time pitch display
- Latency and accuracy measurements documented
- Recommendation: proceed as-is, adjust buffer size, or consider alternative algorithm

### Result

**PASS.** YIN on iOS meets all targets. See `docs/yin-comparison-results.md` for detailed accuracy comparison between real-time YIN and batch analysis.

## Spike B: YouTube Looping in WKWebView

### Question

Can we embed a YouTube video in WKWebView, control it programmatically (play, pause, seek, speed, mute), and implement reliable A-B looping with +/-100ms precision?

### Approach

1. Create a minimal SwiftUI app with a WKWebView
2. Load the YouTube IFrame Player API in the web view
3. Implement Swift -> JS bridge for playback control
4. Implement JS -> Swift message handler for player state events
5. Build A-B loop logic: on `onStateChange` or timer, check `getCurrentTime()` and seek to A when reaching B
6. Test seek precision at various speeds (0.5x, 1x, 1.5x)

### Success Criteria

| Metric            | Target                               | How to Measure                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Seek precision    | +/-100ms                             | Compare `seekTo(t)` vs `getCurrentTime()` after seek |
| Loop continuity   | No audible gap on loop restart       | Listen test across 20+ loop cycles                   |
| Speed control     | 0.25x-2x works                       | Test `setPlaybackRate()` at each step                |
| Mute/unmute       | Instant, no audio leak               | Test `mute()`/`unMute()` transitions                 |
| JS bridge latency | < 50ms round trip                    | Timestamp Swift call -> JS response                  |
| Reliability       | No player crashes over 30min session | Extended playback test                               |

### Risks

- **YouTube API restrictions**: Some videos may block embedded playback or disable `playsinline` -> test with various video types
- **Seek imprecision**: YouTube's seek may overshoot by 0.5-2 seconds on some videos -> implement compensating logic
- **WKWebView audio routing**: When YouTube is muted and stems play via AVAudioEngine, ensure no audio session conflicts
- **Rate limiting**: Frequent `getCurrentTime()` polling may have overhead -> find optimal polling interval

### Deliverables

- Working prototype with YouTube embed, playback controls, and A-B looping
- Seek precision measurements at different speeds
- Audio session compatibility notes (YouTube muted + AVAudioEngine)

### Result

**PASS.** YouTube IFrame API works reliably in WKWebView with programmatic control. Seek precision is acceptable. Audio session `.mixWithOthers` resolves coexistence with AVAudioEngine.

## Spike C: StemSplit API Integration

### Question

Does the StemSplit API produce stems of sufficient quality for practice purposes, within acceptable time and cost?

### Approach

Submitted test songs through the StemSplit API and evaluated results.

### Test Songs

| #   | Genre    | Song                                | Duration |
| --- | -------- | ----------------------------------- | -------- |
| 1   | Jazz/Pop | Michael Buble — "Feeling Good"      | 3:59     |
| 2   | Acoustic | Carole King — "You've Got A Friend" | 5:10     |

### Results

#### Processing Time

| Song                | Processing Time | Notes                        |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Feeling Good        | ~69 seconds     | 3:59 song processed in ~1m   |
| You've Got A Friend | ~87 seconds     | 5:10 song processed in ~1.5m |

Both well within the 5-minute target.

#### Stem Output

**Critical finding:** The StemSplit YouTube endpoint (`POST /youtube-jobs`) only returns **3 outputs**: `fullAudio`, `vocals`, `instrumental`. The `SIX_STEMS` output type is only available on the file upload endpoint (`POST /jobs`).

| Output       | Song 1 Size | Song 2 Size | Bitrate | Format |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------- | ------- | ------ |
| vocals       | 9.1 MB      | 12 MB       | 320kbps | MP3    |
| instrumental | 9.1 MB      | 12 MB       | 320kbps | MP3    |
| fullAudio    | (skipped)   | (skipped)   | 320kbps | MP3    |

#### Cost Analysis

| Metric              | Value                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Credits charged     | 239 + 310 = 549 seconds (~9.2 minutes) |
| Cost model          | Credits = audio duration in seconds    |
| Cost per song (avg) | ~$0.46 at $0.10/min (4.5 min avg)      |

**Note:** In IntonavioLocal, the user provides their own StemSplit API key. Costs are borne directly by the user.

### Recommendation

**Conditional GO** — StemSplit works well for vocal/instrumental separation (fast, good quality at 320kbps). However:

1. **YouTube flow limitation**: Only produces vocals + instrumental (2 useful stems). For 6-stem separation (drums, bass, piano, guitar), the file upload flow is needed.
2. **For singing practice**, vocals + instrumental is sufficient — the instrumental serves as the backing track.
3. **Cost is reasonable** at ~$0.46/song, charged to user's own API key.

| 5   | Document results              | Document results             | Cost analysis + document     |

### Go/No-Go Decision

All spikes passed. Proceeded to full implementation.
