# IntonavioLocal — UI Views & Flow

## Context

Defining all views, navigation, and layout decisions for the IntonavioLocal singing practice app. This covers iOS (primary) and macOS (shared codebase).

---

## Views

### Home (Tab 1: Library)

1. **Home** — Two sections stacked vertically:
   - **Song Library** — Grid of user's songs (thumbnail, title, artist, status badge). "Add Song" button.
   - **Exercises** — Horizontal scrollable categories (Scales, Arpeggios, Intervals, Vibrato, Breathing). Pre-built exercises ship with app.

2. **Add Song Sheet** — YouTube URL input, validation, submit. Shows processing progress after submission (splitting -> downloading -> analyzing -> ready).

### Practice

3. **Song Practice** — Full-screen, toggleable layout between two modes:
   - **Lyrics-focused**: Video ~65%, pitch graph ~35%
   - **Pitch-focused**: Video ~25% (small strip), pitch graph ~75%
   - Swipe or tap button to toggle between layouts
   - **Controls overlay**: Play/pause, A-B loop markers, stem mode selector (Original / Vocals / Instrumental), transpose picker (musical intervals from -2 octaves to +2 octaves)
   - **Loop score toast**: When A-B loop is active, a toast overlay appears after each pass showing the score percentage and improvement delta (green arrow up / red arrow down). Auto-dismisses after 2 seconds.
   - **Progress sheet** (toolbar button, chart icon): Shows overall best score and per-phrase score breakdown. Tapping a phrase row sets up an A-B loop around that phrase (with breathing room), dismisses the sheet, and seeks to the phrase start — without auto-playing. User presses play to start the loop.
   - **YouTube video**: Non-interactive — covered by a transparent touch-blocking overlay. All playback controlled via controls bar.
   - **Piano roll**: Interactive — touch to pause, swipe to scrub with momentum, long-press to loop a phrase (see Piano Roll Touch Gestures below).

4. **Exercise Practice** — Same pitch graph as song practice but no video. Shows exercise name, target notes as reference, and tempo/metronome guide.

### Pitch Graph Component (shared by views 3 & 4)

- Piano roll style: piano keys on Y-axis, scrolling time on X-axis
- **Interactive gestures**: Touch to pause, swipe to scrub with momentum, long-press to loop a phrase (see Piano Roll Touch Gestures below)
- **3 visualization modes** (user toggles via segmented control):
  - **Target Zones + Colored Line**: Reference pitch as semi-transparent bands, user's live pitch as a continuous line colored by accuracy
  - **Two Distinct Lines**: Reference as thin dashed neutral line, user's pitch as bold colored line
  - **Target Zones + Glowing Trail**: Reference as bands, user's pitch as animated glowing trail with intensity based on accuracy
- Current note name displayed large (left side), with cents deviation indicator
- Scrolling window: ~4s past + 4s future visible
- **Browsing mode**: When scrubbing, the playhead switches to dashed style and a dimmed secondary line shows actual playback position

### Sessions (Tab 2)

5. **Session History** — List of past practice sessions (date, song/exercise name, duration, score)
6. **Session Detail** — Replay pitch graph (scrubbable), score breakdown, loop points used, speed used

### Settings (Tab 3)

7. **Settings** — Sections:
   - **StemSplit API** — API key management (navigate to API Key settings view, shows checkmark if key is set)
   - **Audio Input** — Microphone/input device selection
   - **Guide Tone** — Instrument selection for guide tone playback
   - **Difficulty** — Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced with zone width preview
   - **Data** — Storage usage display
   - **About** — App version
   - **Developer** (DEBUG only) — Developer tools and diagnostics

8. **API Key Settings** — Enter/update/remove StemSplit API key (stored in Keychain, displayed masked)
9. **Guide Tone Settings** — Select instrument for guide tone from available options
10. **Developer View** (DEBUG only) — Diagnostic tools for debugging

### Piano Roll Touch Gestures

The piano roll responds to touch gestures for interactive browsing:

| Gesture                   | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Touch and hold**        | Pauses playback immediately. Lifting the finger (short tap) keeps playback paused at the current position.                                                                           |
| **Drag (swipe)**          | Enters browsing mode — the displayed time decouples from playback. The graph scrolls with the finger. A dashed playhead and dimmed secondary line show the actual playback position. |
| **Lift after drag**       | Starts momentum scrolling with deceleration (friction 0.95/frame at 60fps). When momentum stops, playback auto-resumes from the browsed position.                                    |
| **Touch during momentum** | Stops the momentum engine and re-enters the touch-and-hold state (pauses playback).                                                                                                  |
| **Long press (~1s)**      | Finds the phrase at the touch position (or nearest phrase within +/-2s) and sets up an A-B loop around it. Haptic feedback on iOS.                                                   |

**Browsing mode state machine:**

```
IDLE → [touch] → TOUCHING (pause, start 1s timer)
  TOUCHING → [drag > 10pt] → DRAGGING (cancel timer, scroll graph)
  TOUCHING → [1s elapsed] → LONG PRESS (find phrase → loop)
  TOUCHING → [lift < 1s] → IDLE (stay paused)
  DRAGGING → [lift] → MOMENTUM (decelerate → auto-resume)
  MOMENTUM → [decay stops] → seek + play → IDLE
  MOMENTUM → [touch] → TOUCHING (stop engine, re-pause)
```

### Pitch Visualization Modes (toggle via segmented control on graph)

| Mode         | Reference Display              | User Display                                 | Feel                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Zones + Line | Semi-transparent colored bands | Solid colored line (accuracy colors)         | Clean, analytical   |
| Two Lines    | Thin dashed gray line          | Bold colored line                            | Direct comparison   |
| Zones + Glow | Semi-transparent bands         | Glowing animated trail, intensity = accuracy | Engaging, game-like |

### Accuracy Color Scale

Colors are consistent across all difficulty levels; the cent thresholds change per level (see `docs/06-realtime-pitch.md`).

- **Green**: Excellent (within tightest zone)
- **Yellow**: Good (middle zone)
- **Orange**: Fair (outer zone)
- **Gray**: Poor (outside all zones)

Difficulty is selected in Settings -> Difficulty (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced). Zone bands on the piano roll visually widen or narrow to reflect the selected level.

## Verification

- Wireframe each view before implementation
- Prototype the toggleable layout with dummy data to validate feel
- Test pitch graph rendering at 43 FPS with simultaneous video playback (performance critical)
- Validate A-B loop controls are reachable in both layout modes
- Test all 3 pitch visualization modes with real microphone input
- Test piano roll gestures: touch -> playback pauses; swipe -> graph scrolls with momentum -> playback resumes from new position; long-press ~1s -> loop created around nearest phrase
- Verify browsing edge cases: touch during momentum stops scrolling, song boundary clamping, play pressed while browsing seeks to browsed position
